This App implements functionalities of 5 Image recognition APIs built with
machine learning & deep learning.

ðŸ‘ˆ Please select **Image Playground** in the sidebar to start.

## Facial Recognition

**It detects and recognizes faces in any image By leveraging a deep neural network trained on small, blurry, and shadowy faces of all ages, this service is able to automatically detect faces with a high level of accuracy.**
